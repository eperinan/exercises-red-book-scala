# Exercise02-01

Write a recursive function to get the nth Fibonacci number. The first two Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1. The nth number is always the sum of the previous two-the sequence begins 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5. Your definition should use a local tail-recursive function.

```def fib(n: Int): Int```
